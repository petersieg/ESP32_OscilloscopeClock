```
  Small alterations 2022-08-02 P. Sieg:
  * Made digit arabian 4 a bit bigger (DataTable.h)
  * User GPIO33 and GPIO32:
    #define DIGIT_TYPE  32 // 1=Default=Arabian numbers; 0=Roman numbers 
    #define NO_DIGITS   33 // 1=Default=Show numbers; 0=No numbers, just dots / sec tick marks
    
  Small alterations 2022-08-05 P. Sieg:
  * Corrected roman 4 from wrong IIII to correct IV

  Small alterations 2022-08-10 P. Sieg:
  * MIRROR-X function to mirror x signal (for ex. needed by zo393/pm3230 scopes etc.

```

  How to use it:
  
  Load this sketch on a ESP32 board using the Arduino IDE 1.8.7
  See Andreas Spiess video linked below if you don't know how to...
  Connect your oscilloscope channels to GPIO25 and GPIO26 of the ESP32
  Connect the ground of the oscilloscope to the GND of the ESP32 board
  Put your Oscilloscope in XY mode
  Adjust the vertical scale of the used channels to fit the clock

  Enjoy Your new Oscilloscope Clock!!! :)

  Additional notes:
  
  NTP Sync
  
  By default this sketch will start from a fix time 10:08:37 everityme 
  you reset the board.
  
  To change it, modify the variables h,m,s below.
  To synchronize the clock with an NTP server, you have to install 
  the library NTPtimeESP from Andreas Spiess.
  Then ncomment the line //#define NTP, removing the //.
  Edit the WiFi credential in place of Your SSID and Your PASS.
  Check in the serial monitor if it can reach the NTP server.
  You mignt need to chouse a different pool server for your country.
  
  The NTPtimeESP library was meant for the ESP8266 and you need to adit the file NTPtimeESP.h to use it with the ESP32.
  Open up the "NTPtimeESP.h" inside the library and replace the "#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>" with "#include <WiFi.h>".
  
  TimeZone Change
  
  You needed to modify the "NTPch.getNTPtime(1.0, 1);" request to fit your TimeZone. 
  Simply change the first argument with your required GMT offset. So for Italy (GMT +1) I've set it to 1.0.
  For Pacific Coastal Zone (GMT -8), you need to change "NTPch.getNTPtime(1.0, 1);"  to "NTPch.getNTPtime(-8.0, 1);".
  
  EXCEL XY Coordinates Test
  
  If you want there is also a special mode that can be enabled uncommenting 
  the line //#define EXCEL, removing the //. In this mode, the sketch
  will run once and will output on the serial monitor all the coordinates
  it has generated. You can use this coordinates to draw the clock 
  using the graph function in Excel or LibreOffice
  This is useful to test anything you want to display on the oscilloscope
  to verify the actual points that will be generated.
